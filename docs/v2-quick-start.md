# LoopyComfy v2.0 Quick Start Guide

## ðŸš€ Getting Started with Advanced Features

This guide helps you quickly enable and use LoopyComfy v2.0's advanced features like real-time processing, ML enhancements, and GPU acceleration.

## Prerequisites

- LoopyComfy v1.x installed and working
- Python 3.8+ (3.12 recommended)
- ComfyUI running successfully
- Additional hardware for advanced features:
  - **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with 4GB+ VRAM (for GPU acceleration)
  - **CPU**: 8+ cores recommended (for parallel processing)
  - **RAM**: 16GB+ recommended (for ML models)

## Step 1: Enable Basic v2.0 Features

### 1.1 Edit Configuration
```bash
# Navigate to your loopy-comfy directory
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/loopy-comfy

# Edit the configuration file
nano config/advanced_features.yaml  # or use your preferred editor
```

### 1.2 Basic Configuration
Enable features gradually, starting with the safest options:

```yaml
# config/advanced_features.yaml
version: "2.0.0"

features:
  # Start with resource monitoring (safe)
  resource_monitoring:
    enabled: true
    
  # Enable parallel processing for speed boost
  parallel_processing:
    enabled: true
    max_workers: 4  # Adjust based on your CPU cores
    
  # Optional: Basic real-time features
  real_time:
    enabled: false  # Keep disabled initially
```

## Step 2: Test Basic Features

### 2.1 Restart ComfyUI
```bash
# Stop ComfyUI (Ctrl+C)
# Wait for complete shutdown
# Restart ComfyUI
python main.py  # or however you start ComfyUI
```

### 2.2 Verify Features
Check ComfyUI console for v2.0 initialization messages:
```
[LoopyComfy v2.0] Configuration loaded successfully
[LoopyComfy v2.0] Resource monitoring: ENABLED
[LoopyComfy v2.0] Parallel processing: ENABLED (4 workers)
[LoopyComfy v2.0] System ready with advanced features
```

## Step 3: Enable GPU Acceleration (Optional)

### 3.1 Install GPU Dependencies
```bash
# Check CUDA version first
nvidia-smi

# Install CuPy for your CUDA version
pip install cupy-cuda11x  # For CUDA 11.x
pip install cupy-cuda12x  # For CUDA 12.x
```

### 3.2 Enable GPU Features
```yaml
# config/advanced_features.yaml
features:
  gpu_acceleration:
    enabled: true
    memory_fraction: 0.7  # Use 70% of GPU memory
    kernel_optimization: true
```

### 3.3 Test GPU Acceleration
Create a simple workflow and monitor GPU usage:
```bash
# Monitor GPU usage while processing
nvidia-smi -l 1  # Updates every second
```

## Step 4: Enable ML-Enhanced Transitions (Advanced)

### 4.1 Install ML Dependencies
```bash
# Install PyTorch
pip install torch torchvision

# Verify installation
python -c "import torch; print(f'CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"
```

### 4.2 Enable ML Features
```yaml
# config/advanced_features.yaml
features:
  ml_enhanced:
    enabled: true
    model_quality: "auto"  # Automatically selects best model for your hardware
    cache_enabled: true
```

### 4.3 Model Quality Tiers
- **"auto"**: Automatically selects based on available hardware
- **"full"**: ResNet50 (requires 8GB+ GPU memory)
- **"lite"**: MobileNetV3 (requires 4GB+ GPU memory)
- **"cpu"**: Custom CNN (works on any hardware)

## Step 5: Enable Real-Time Processing (Expert)

### 5.1 Install Streaming Dependencies
```bash
pip install websockets
```

### 5.2 Enable Real-Time Features
```yaml
# config/advanced_features.yaml
features:
  real_time:
    enabled: true
    websocket:
      host: "localhost"
      port: 8765
      auth_token: "your-secure-token-here"
```

### 5.3 Access Performance Dashboard
1. Start ComfyUI with v2.0 features enabled
2. Open browser to: `http://localhost:8188/loopy-comfy/dashboard`
3. Enter your auth token when prompted
4. Monitor real-time performance metrics

## Step 6: Performance Optimization

### 6.1 Monitor System Performance
Use the built-in resource monitor:
```python
# In ComfyUI console or Python
from core.v2.resource_monitor import ResourceMonitor
from core.v2.config_manager import AdvancedFeaturesConfig

config = AdvancedFeaturesConfig()
monitor = ResourceMonitor(config)
recommendations = monitor.get_recommended_quality()
print(recommendations)
```

### 6.2 Adjust Settings Based on Hardware
Based on monitor recommendations, adjust your configuration:

**High-End System (16GB+ RAM, 8GB+ GPU):**
```yaml
features:
  parallel_processing:
    enabled: true
    max_workers: 8
  gpu_acceleration:
    enabled: true
    memory_fraction: 0.8
  ml_enhanced:
    enabled: true
    model_quality: "full"
```

**Mid-Range System (8-16GB RAM, 4GB+ GPU):**
```yaml
features:
  parallel_processing:
    enabled: true
    max_workers: 4
  gpu_acceleration:
    enabled: true
    memory_fraction: 0.6
  ml_enhanced:
    enabled: true
    model_quality: "lite"
```

**Budget System (8GB RAM, CPU only):**
```yaml
features:
  parallel_processing:
    enabled: true
    max_workers: 2
  gpu_acceleration:
    enabled: false
  ml_enhanced:
    enabled: true
    model_quality: "cpu"
```

## Step 7: Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**GPU Not Detected:**
```bash
# Check CUDA installation
nvidia-smi
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"

# Reinstall CUDA toolkit if needed
# Install correct CuPy version
```

**WebSocket Connection Failed:**
- Check firewall settings
- Ensure port 8765 is not in use
- Verify auth token is correct
- Try different port in configuration

**ML Models Not Loading:**
```bash
# Check PyTorch installation
python -c "import torch; import torchvision; print('ML dependencies OK')"

# Clear model cache if corrupted
rm -rf ~/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/
```

**Performance Issues:**
1. Check resource monitor recommendations
2. Reduce parallel workers
3. Lower GPU memory fraction
4. Switch to lighter ML model quality

### Getting Help

1. **Check logs**: Look in ComfyUI console for v2.0 messages
2. **Resource monitor**: Use built-in recommendations
3. **Test individual features**: Enable one feature at a time
4. **Fallback system**: v2.0 automatically falls back to safer options

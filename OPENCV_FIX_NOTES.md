# OpenCV Compatibility Fix for ComfyUI

## Issue Resolved
ComfyUI embedded Python had incompatibility between NumPy 2.x and OpenCV, causing nodes to fail loading.

## Solution Applied
1. **NumPy Downgrade**: Installed NumPy 1.26.4 (compatible with OpenCV)
2. **OpenCV Stable**: Installed OpenCV 4.9.0 (tested compatibility)
3. **Full Restoration**: All original functionality restored

## Installation Commands for ComfyUI
```bash
cd /path/to/ComfyUI_windows_portable
./python_embeded/python.exe -m pip uninstall -y opencv-python opencv-contrib-python
./python_embeded/python.exe -m pip install "numpy<2" opencv-python==4.9.0.80 --force-reinstall
```

## Features Restored
- ✅ Seamless loop validation
- ✅ Video thumbnail generation  
- ✅ Frame comparison algorithms
- ✅ Full metadata extraction
- ✅ Original type hints and IntelliSense

## Validation
All nodes now load successfully with full OpenCV functionality:
- VideoAssetLoader: Complete metadata and validation
- MarkovVideoSequencer: Full transition analysis
- VideoSequenceComposer: Frame processing and conversion
- VideoSaver: Professional encoding options

This fix ensures production-quality video processing capabilities.
